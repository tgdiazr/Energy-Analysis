# Energy-Analysis

*Project Overview
This project explores global and national trends in energy consumption, renewable adoption, and carbon emissions using the Our World in Data Energy Dataset. The goal is to uncover insights into how countries are transitioning to sustainable energy sources, the role of fossil fuels, and the environmental impact of energy systems.

*Key Questions Explored

How has primary energy consumption changed globally and by region since 1965?

What is the share of renewables in electricity generation across top-emitting countries?

Are there correlations between GDP growth and fossil fuel dependency?

Which countries lead in reducing carbon intensity of their energy systems?

How do per capita energy trends compare between high-income and low-income nations?

*Tools & Workflow
-Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values and standardized country/region names.

Merged datasets (energy, GDP, population).

-Exploratory Analysis:

Python libraries: pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly.

SQL queries for regional aggregates.

-Visualization:

Interactive maps (Plotly/Power Bi) showing renewable adoption.

Time-series plots of fossil fuel vs. renewable energy shares.

-Statistical Modeling:

Regression analysis to link GDP and energy consumption.

Clustering countries by energy transition progress.

*Key Insights
-Global Trends: Fossil fuels still dominate (~80% of primary energy), but solar/wind grew by 15% YoY.

-Leaders in Renewables: Iceland (90% geothermal), Norway (hydropower), and Germany (solar/wind).

-Challenges: Carbon intensity remains high in coal-dependent economies (e.g., China, India).

-Opportunities: Africaâ€™s solar potential is underutilized (2% of global solar capacity).
